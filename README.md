# SILA-AD-Biomarker
The sampled iterative local approximation algorithm was developed by Dr. Betthauser at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to model longitudinal amyloid PET data and estimate individual A+ onset age. This algorithm may have applications in other areas where long-term population trajectories can be surmised from shorter individual longitudinal assessments.
